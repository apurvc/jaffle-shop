# A Fork of Jaffle shop github repo to setup against Bigquery

# ðŸ¥ª The Jaffle Shop BigQuery Fork ðŸ¦˜
*Original repository here https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-shop*

**Setup you can run in cloud shell**

```bash
python -m venv dbt-env
source dbt-env/bin/activate
(optional) pip install -r requirements.txt (if you want to generate sample data)
pip install dbt-core dbt-bigquery
```

2. Update **GCP project id** in `profiles.yml` and then run `dbt deps` to test if the configs are correct for you to run against BigQuery.

```bash
dbt deps # installs the dependency defined in packages.yml

dbt debug # test connection with bigquery and profile is correctly setup

Sample run

3. As DBT transforms existing data we will populate some raw data present in jaffle-data folder. If you want to generate more data check `seed-paths` config in your `dbt-project.yml`, you can run `jafgen` and then `seed` to work on generated data. This is another approach people use for testing the transformations.

```bash
(optional) jafgen [number of years to generate] # e.g. jafgen 6
dbt seed # it will load the data raw data in bigquery. 
```

4. Execute `dbt run` to get the transformations done on Raw data.

```bash
dbt run

** Docs and Lineage ** 
5. Execute `dbt docs generate ` to get the documentations generated for the code.

```bash
(dbt-env) cloud_user_p_c2d60e26@cloudshell:~/jaffle-shop (playground-s-11-96c13f89)$ dbt docs generate
19:55:51  Running with dbt=1.8.3
19:55:52  Registered adapter: bigquery=1.8.2

```

5. Once successfull run `dbt docs serve --port 8080` in cloud shell to get the docs served locally. For production use cases this can be served from bucket or other appropriate approaches.

```bash
19:56:49  Running with dbt=1.8.3
http://localhost:8080
Serving docs at 8080

```

you can open the browser to localhost:8080 , as we are using cloud shell we use the Web preview option as described in https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-web-preview
